I made a test battle scene, just to make things a bit easier for you. If you don't want to use it, then follow these steps:

1. Drag Battle Canvas into Scene 
2. Drag Battle System into Scene
3. Go to Battle Canvas and find "EnemyHUD"
4. Drag that into the Battle System's "Enemy HUD" Slot

BattleSystem is just a GameObject that holds the "Create Enemy" Script, which is used to spawn the enemy in when the battle starts. The Create Enemy script 
currently also holds the "Enemy Turn" function, that just has the enemy take damage and print if it's dead or not. This can be moved/removed
while we wait for the player to actually work n junk.
